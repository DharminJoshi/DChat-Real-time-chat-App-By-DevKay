To get started with **DChat-Real-time-chat-App-By-DevKay**, follow these steps to engage in the chat and make full use of the app's features.

### 1. **Join the Chat**
   - Upon loading the app, you'll be prompted to enter your **name**. This helps personalize your experience and allows other users to know who's chatting.
   - Once you've entered your name, you'll be taken to the main chat interface where you can start interacting with others.

   - Start typing messages in the input field at the bottom of the screen.
   - As you type, your messages are instantly sent to the chat and displayed in real time for all participants.

     ```
   - Replace `<username>` with the person's name (make sure it's accurate) and `<message>` with your message.

### 4. **Viewing Active Users**
   - The app will display a **live user list** on the sidebar (or a dedicated section depending on your layout), showing all the active participants in the chat.
   - The list updates automatically as people join or leave, so you always know who‚Äôs online and participating in the conversation.
